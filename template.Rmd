```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r round(mean(samp), 2)`.


# Section 3
This is going to make a plot! First I generate a dataframe, then
use `ggplot` to make a scatterplot.

## Plot from last time

```{r}
plot_df =
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 1000),
    y = 1 + 2 * x ^ 2 + rnorm(n = 1000)
  )

ggp = ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
ggp
```

## Plot for leanring assessment
This is a quick kind of solution to the LA

```{r}
la_df = 
  tibble(
    norm = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 1),
    logical = norm > 0,
    abs_norm = abs(norm)
  )

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_norm)) + geom_histogram()
```

Here's a list:

* List item 1
* List item 2
